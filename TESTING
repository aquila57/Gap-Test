Testing instructions for all the gap test programs in this
repository.

Read REFERENCES for information about the gap test.

--------

Program by program testing instructions.

Fibonacci random number generator

Run fibogap to apply the gap test to the fibonacci random number
generator.  There are no parameters.

./fibogap

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

64 bit LFSR random number generator

Run lfsrgap to apply the gap test to the 64 bit LFSR random
number generator.  There are no parameters.

./lfsrgap

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

32 bit RANDU random number generator

Run randu to apply the gap test to the 32 bit
RANDU random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./rugap

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

Sine wave random number generator

Run randu to apply the gap test to the sine wave random
number generator.  There are no parameters.

./sinegap

This program is expected to fail the test.

--------

eegl64 random number generator

Run gaptest to apply the gap test to the eegl64 uniform random
number generator.  There are no parameters.

./gaptest

This test is expected to pass.

--------

etaus random number generator

Run etausgap to apply the gap test to the etaus uniform
random number generator.  There are no parameters.

./etausgap

This test is expected to pass.

--------

GNU Scientific Library random number generators

Run tstgsl.sh to apply the gap test to the GNU Scientific
Library collection of random number generators.
There is one parameter. the name of the GSL generator.

./tstgsl.sh RNG_name 

Example,

./tstgsl.sh taus2

This example runs the gap test on the GSL taus2 random
number generator.

To find a list of valid GSL random number generators, enter
a parameter that produces an error.

./tstgsl.sh ?

This test is expected to pass the test except for three "random32"
generators.

To run a test of all GSL generators, run runall.sh.

./runall.sh

Read the results of this test by browsing allgsl.out.
This test reads allgsl.lst as an input file.

--------

Dieharder package random number generators

Run tstdie.sh to apply the gap test to the dieharder collection
of random number generators.  There is one parameter, the id of
the dieharder generator.

./tstdie.sh RNG_number

Example,

./tstdie.sh 053

This example runs the gap test on the dieharder taus2 random
number generator.

To find a list of valid dieharder random number generators,
enter the following dieharder command.

dieharder -g -l

This test is expected to pass the test except for the uni
generator.

To run a test of all dieharder generators, run dieall.sh.

./dieall.sh

Read the results of this test by browsing alldie.out.
This test reads alldie.lst as an input file.
